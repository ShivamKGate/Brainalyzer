Yep, this project name is taken from Rick and Morty. This project does a lot more than referencing a show though. Below is the Project Synopsis of what it can do:
1. A dashboard that displays charts and graphs outputted from datasets, for analzing brain strokes.
2. A deep learning classifier for brain tumors, etc.
3. A LLM for queries about brain damage, hemorrhages etc.
4. Predictor for brain diseases.
5. Brain fog vs causing factors, basically an algorithm that can predict your brain fog and analyze it, making graphs too.

My Stack Includes:
Front-End: React, CSS
Back-End: Flask, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, PyTorch
Datasets from Kaggle.

BIG DAY, LOTS TO DO!
